    "# Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover the documentation for Nd-Multicore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case:\n",
    "This module is currently used for running embarrassingly parallel pipelines on data located in the BOSS. However, the modularity of the code should allow for further parallel functions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the current pipeline accomplishes the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reads in BOSS data parameters through a neurodata.cfg file\n",
    "2. Breaks data into blocks.\n",
    "3. Runs any specified function on each block of data in a parallel fashion (using python3 multiprocessing library)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes:\n",
    "1. The function should accept a python dictionary as its only non-default parameter. The dictionary will contain channels as the keys and the raw data from the BOSS (usually numpy array) as the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the notebook will focus on the steps of the pipeline and how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Loading BOSS Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to load the resource from the BOSS. We do this through the NeuroDataResource.py file and class. Look into neurodata.cfg.example to see what parameters you have to provide. This code is mostly handled for you and there should be little changes you have to make to it. For reference though, here is how the NeuroDataResource class functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should mainly concern yourself with the class variables and the get_cutout function if you are modifying this code so we just listed those below. If you want the entire source code, just open the python file."
